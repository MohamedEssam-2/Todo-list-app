# ✅ To-Do List Web App

A simple and interactive **To-Do List** web application built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with a timestamp. No frameworks, no libraries — just clean, static front-end development.

   - A new list item is created

   - A timestamp shows when the task was added
   - A delete (❌) button appears to remove the task
3. All actions update the DOM dynamically without reloading the page
