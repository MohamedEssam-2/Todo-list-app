# ✅ To-Do List Web App

A simple and interactive **To-Do List** web application built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with a timestamp. No frameworks, no libraries — just clean, static front-end development.

- 🕐 Timestamp showing when each task was added  
- ❌ Delete tasks easily using the "x" button  
- ✅ Checkbox to mark tasks visually  
- 📱 Fully responsive for mobile and desktop views  
- 🎨 Custom fonts and styling using Google Fonts & Font Awesome

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure and elements  
- **CSS3** – layout, colors, responsiveness (media queries)  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – task creation, deletion, DOM manipulation  
- **Google Fonts** – `Work Sans`  
- **Font Awesome** – optional icon support

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a task in the input field
2. On clicking the **"Add Task"** button:
   - A new list item is created
   - A checkbox is added beside the task
   - A timestamp shows when the task was added
   - A delete (❌) button appears to remove the task
3. All actions update the DOM dynamically without reloading the page
